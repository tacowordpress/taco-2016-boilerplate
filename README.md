# Taco 2016 Boilerplate Documentation

This boilerplate does not include WordPress. Instead it uses composer to install the latest version of WordPress and the dependencies in the the taco-theme folder. The intention is to keep WordPress out of project repositories so it can auto updated independently of the wp-content directory.

### Installation â€“ Coming Soon
This branch is no longer in sync with master and needs a documentation update.
